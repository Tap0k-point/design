        <h3>Don’t go to design college.</h3>
        <p>My formally-trained designer friends will hate me for saying this. Let me explain.</p>
        <p>There are a few ways you can learn design.</p>
        <p>You can go to college. It will be expensive. After a few years, you’ll walk away with a degree and start
            looking for a job.</p>
        <p><i>How does this sound: simply implementing the most important principles within weeks?</i></p>
        <p>Just to be clear — I'm not saying that formal education is pointless. It's just not accessible to everyone.
            We have a limited amount of time and money we all want to make the most of both.</p>
        <p>I spent years distilling down my knowledge of graphic design into some very simple concepts. It's the "pareto
            principle" in action: about 20% of what I've learned makes up 80% of every design I create.</p>
        <p>I'll teach you exactly the tricks you need to start working on projects (your own or someone else's) within
            weeks.</p>
        <p>Whether you aspire to freelance, work at a startup, develop your own product, or eventually get a job at
            Apple, it's a no-nonsense, cheap start to learning the craft.</p>

                        find anything at all. No one else explains like "okay, you shouldn't do that, you should do

        <h2>Questions?</h2>

        <div class="grid-50 mobile-grid-100">
            <strong>What if I’m not happy with the book?</strong>
            <p>You get a 100% refund, no questions asked. There’s not even a time limit — you can buy the book today and
                get a refund one year later. I am that confident that you’ll find amazing value in this book.</p>

            <strong>What is the purchase process?</strong>
            <p>I use Gumroad to process payment. It supports all credit cards. After payment, you’ll immediately get the
                book in pdf format straight into your inbox. Contact me if any problem arises.</p>
            <strong>Do I need to know Photoshop?</strong>
            <p>This book is tool-agnostic. All the tips and tutorials are applicable to different tools, some of which
                are also featured in the book to help you pick one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-50 mobile-grid-100">
            <strong>What if I change my mind or hate the product?</strong>
            <p>I’ve offered a lifetime money-back guarantee on my products in the past — it’s the same with this one.
                This simply means that if you ever feel like the product wasn’t what was promised or you didn’t get
                enough value out of it, you can contact me and I’ll refund every $.
            </p>

            <strong>Is this a replacement for design college?</strong>
            <p>No. This product will give you essential skills to "test-drive" working in design. Many design jobs don't
                require a college degree — however, do expect to invest more work into learning design and practice
                before you're able to win a Red Dot.
